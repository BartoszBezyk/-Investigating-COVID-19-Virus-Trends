Investigating COVID-19 Virus Trends

A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China was first internationally reported from China on 31 December 2019. Today we know this virus as Coronavirus. COVID-19, which stands for COronaVIrus Disease, is the disease caused by this virus. Since then, the world has been engaged in the fight against this pandemic. Several measures have therefore been taken to "flatten the curve". We have consequently experienced social distancing, and unfortunately, many lives have been lost.

In the solidarity to face this unprecedented global crisis, several organizations did not hesitate to share several datasets allowing the conduction of various kinds of analysis in order to understand this pandemic.

The objective of this analysis is to identify the countries with the highest number of positive cases in relation to the number of tests conducted.
